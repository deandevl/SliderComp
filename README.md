## slider-comp

**slider-comp** is an on-going project working with transitions in the Vue.js framework.  The component itself is a simple image slider.

Three [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/) npm scripts are included for building  development, production, or hot recompile/execute of the demo.   `build-dev` and `build-prod` scripts produce  a `dist` folder containing the `index.html`.  The size of the `main.js` bundle using `build-prod` is 9 KiB along with calling a CDN for incorporating the Vue framework.
